#  Implementation of LEMP (Linux-Nginx-MySQL-PHP) webstack on AWS

### Steps

1. Create a Security group for the EC2 instance defining desired inbound rules from target IPs
     ![Security group for EC2](./images/security-group.png)
2. Launched EC2 instance, selecting an Ubuntu free tier
3. Made necessary configurations (Enabling Public IP, Assigning security group created in 2, creating key)-value pair) needed to run the EC2 instance.

4. SSH-ed into the EC2 instance using the windows terminal
    - Downloaded the Windows SSH from the windows store
    - Followed steps in [ARTICLE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?source=recommendations&tabs=powershell) in installing and configuring OpenSSH in windows.
    - The openSSH allows remote access into our EC2 instance from the windows terminal.
    - Followed steps in [OpenSSH key management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement) to create key authentication management for OpenSSH in windows

## Installing Nginx web server

### Steps

1. `sudo apt update` -- Updating packages in the package manager

2. `sudo apt install nginx` -- Installing Nginx

3. `sudo systemctl status nginx` -- Verifying that Nginx is successfully installed and running.

    ![Verifying status of Nginx](./images/verifying-status-of-nginx.png)

    - Check to see if installed Nginx is accessible on Ubuntu server
    - To do so, run `curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4` to get the IP address of the device
    - Entering [Checking Apache HTTP server response to requests from the internet](http://<Public-IP-Address>:80) replacing <Public-IP-Address> with the IP address gotten from above step presents a webpage rendered with the information below.

## Installing MySQL Database
With the Apache server up and running, there is a need to set up a MySQL database for storing and managing relational data for the dynamic website.

### Steps

1. `sudo apt install mysql-server` -- Installing MySQL server on the EC2 instance

2. `sudo mysql` -- To login into the MySQL console.

    Successful login into the MySQL console presents the content below in the terminal.

3. `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';` -- Sets the database root user password to **PassWord.1** 

4. `sudo mysql_secure_installation` -- To set password policy for better database security.


## Installing PHP
With the Apache setup to serve content and MySQL setup for storing and managing data. There is a need for PhP to process code and display dynamic content to the end user.

### Steps

1. `sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql` -- Instals **php-mysql**; a PhP module that allows PHP communicate with MySQL-based databases and **php-fpm** -- *PHP fastCGI process manager*; tells Nginx to pass PHP requests to an external software for processing.

2. `php -v` -- Confirms the version of php installed on machine by displaying console information shown below

## Configuring NGINX to use PHP processor
Similar to Apache's virtual host, Nginx allows creation of server blocks to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server.

Nginx has a server block by default that serves documents out of a directory at */var/www/html*. 

Here, we create a directory structure within */var/www* for our domain website, leaving */var/www/html* in place as the default directory to be served if a client request does not match any other sites

### Steps

1. `sudo mkdir /var/www/projectLEMP` -- Creating a root web directory for our domain

2. `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectLEMP` -- Changes ownership of the directory created in **1** so that the current user assumes ownership

3. `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP` -- Creates and open a new configuration file in Apache's *sites-available*

    ![Create projectLEMP configuration file](./images/Configuration-for-web-server.png)

4. `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` -- Activates configuration by linking to the config file from Nginxâ€™s sites-enabled directory

5. `sudo nginx -t` -- Checks for syntax errors in configuration file
